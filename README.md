# Greenscreen-Filters
This is a mini-project which:
I. Uses the greenscreen technique - (works only if the dimension of both the image is same)
        where the pixels of the background image is overlayed on the foreground image where there is green coloured pixels.
II.Red filter- (works with image of any dimension)
        Here every pixel in the image is converted to its corresponding red hue.
III.Green filter- (works with image of any dimension)
        Here every pixel in the image is converted to its corresponding Green hue.
IV.Blue filter- (works with image of any dimension)
        Here every pixel in the image is converted to its corresponding Blue hue.
        
P.S. -this is the first Project I have uploaded, Feedbacks are always Welcome.
